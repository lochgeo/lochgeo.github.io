I am a software developer from Bangalore, India.

{% include pullquote.html quote="People think that computer science is the art of geniuses but the actual reality is the opposite, just many people doing things that build on each other, like a wall of mini stones - Donald Knuth" %}

I have been working in the IT industry for over 18 years and I specialize in cloud technologies. I am passionate about using cloud solutions to improve the efficiency, security and scalability of banking applications. I have experience in developing and deploying cloud-based applications using various platforms and tools, such as Docker, Kubernetes, etc. I also have skills in programming languages such as Python, C#, etc. 

I enjoy learning new technologies and keeping myself updated with the latest trends and best practices in the cloud domain. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a professional and as a person. I believe that cloud computing is the future of banking and I want to be part of it.
