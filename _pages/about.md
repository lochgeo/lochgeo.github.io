Hello, Iâ€™m a seasoned software developer from Bangalore, India, with a passion for cloud technologies. For the past 18 years, I have been working in the IT industry, creating and delivering innovative cloud solutions for the banking sector. I have extensive knowledge and experience in using various cloud platforms and tools, such as Docker, Kubernetes, etc., as well as programming languages such as Python, C#, etc.

I excel at designing and implementing continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines to automate and streamline the testing and deployment of code changes. I use tools such as Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, GoCD etc. to orchestrate and manage CI/CD workflows. I also adhere to the principles of observability to monitor and troubleshoot the performance and health of cloud applications. I use tools such as Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack, etc. to collect and visualize metrics, logs and traces from cloud services.

In addition to my technical skills, I also have strong leadership and communication skills. I enjoy mentoring and coaching other developers in my team and sharing my knowledge and best practices with them. I believe that teamwork and collaboration are essential for delivering high-quality products and services. I also value feedback and constructive criticism as opportunities to improve myself and my work.

I am always eager to learn new technologies and keep myself updated with the latest trends and best practices in the cloud domain. I thrive on new challenges and opportunities to grow as a professional and as a person. I believe that cloud computing is the future of banking and I want to be part of it.
