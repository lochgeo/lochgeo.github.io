In today's world, businesses are increasingly reliant on software to deliver their products and services. As software becomes more complex, it becomes more difficult to keep track of its performance and behavior. his can lead to problems such as outages, performance degradation, and security vulnerabilities. This is where observability comes in. Observability is the ability to understand what is happening inside a system from the knowledge of the external data it produces.

Cloud computing has made it easier for businesses to deploy and scale their applications. However, it has also made it more difficult to manage and monitor these applications. There are a number of different observability tools available, but they all have one thing in common: they are proprietary. This means that they are owned by a single company, and that company can control how the data is collected, stored, and analyzed. This can be a problem for businesses that want to be able to share their data with other teams or partners, or that want to be able to use different tools for different purposes.

OpenTelemetry is an open-source observability framework that solves this problem. OpenTelemetry began as a merger between two existing projects, OpenTracing and OpenCensus. The goal was to create an open-source project that would provide the same functionality as *Googleâ€™s Tracely library* but with more flexibility in terms of configuration options. It started as a project in 2019, with the first version coming online in early 2021. The project is designed to make a vendor-neutral observability platform by bringing together a myriad of technologiesIt provides a unified way to collect telemetry data from a variety of sources, including logs, metrics, and traces. This data can then be stored in a variety of different ways, and analyzed using a variety of different tools. 

Here are some of the benefits of using OpenTelemetry:

- Vendor-neutral: OpenTelemetry is not tied to any specific vendor. This means that you can choose the tools that best meet your needs, without being locked into a single vendor.
- Flexible: OpenTelemetry is a flexible framework that can be used to collect telemetry data from a variety of sources. This makes it a good choice for businesses that use a variety of different technologies.
- Scalable: OpenTelemetry is designed to scale to meet the needs of even the most demanding applications. This makes it a good choice for businesses that are growing rapidly.
- Cost-effectiveness: OpenTelemetry is an open-source project, which means that it is free to use and modify. This makes it a more cost-effective option than proprietary observability tools.

OpenTelemetry is still under development, but it has already gained a lot of traction in the open-source community. It is supported by a number of different vendors, including Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. This means that businesses can be confident that OpenTelemetry will be around for the long term. If you are looking for an open-source observability framework, then OpenTelemetry is a great option. It is easy to use, and it is supported by a wide range of vendors. If you are already using a proprietary observability tool, then you may want to consider migrating to OpenTelemetry. I really think that it is the future of observability.
