Agile software architecture is a way of designing and developing software systems that embraces change, feedback, and collaboration. It is based on the idea that architecture is not a fixed and upfront activity, but rather an ongoing and emergent process that evolves with the needs of the customers and the environment. Agile architecture aims to balance several aspects of software development, such as functionality, quality, performance, scalability, security, usability, and maintainability. It also considers other factors that affect the delivery of software solutions, such as testability, deployability, operability, and observability. Agile architecture follows some key principles and practices that guide its implementation. Some of these are:

- Architecture as code: The architecture is expressed in executable code rather than documents or diagrams. This enables faster feedback loops, automated testing, continuous integration, and continuous delivery.
- Architecture runway: The architecture provides enough structure and guidance to support current and near-term features without over-engineering or constraining future options.
- Architecture spikes: The architecture is validated through short experiments or prototypes that explore risky or uncertain aspects of the system design.
- Architecture refactoring: The architecture is continuously improved through small and frequent changes that enhance its quality and adaptability.
- Architecture reviews: The architecture is regularly evaluated by stakeholders and peers to ensure its alignment with business goals, technical standards, and best practices.

By applying agile architecture concepts, agile teams can confidently drive sustainable, fit-for-purpose solutions to meet customer needs.
